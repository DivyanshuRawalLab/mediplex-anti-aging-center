                                following testosterone therapy – does it increase risk of blood clots?</h4>
                            <p>In discussions about side effects of testosterone treatment, prostate cancer and heart
                                disease get most attention. However, as we have described in several study reports
                                published here in the “Research News” section, the widespread fear of prostate cancer
                                and heart disease is unfounded and not supported by medical research.</p>

                            <p class="my-3">The expected potential side effect of testosterone treatment – which in fact
                                is a
                                therapeutic effect in men with anemia – is an increased level of red blood cells,
                                known as erythrocytosis or polycythemia. In the context of testosterone treatment,
                                erythrocytosis and polycythemia are used interchangeably to refer to an abnormal
                                increase of red blood cells or hematocrit, which may increase blood viscosity (“blood
                                thickness”).</p>

                        <div class="py-3" style="border-top: 2px solid; border-bottom: 2px solid;">
                            <p>However, it should be pointed out that technically, erythrocytosis is just red blood cell
                                elevation, while polycythemia involves elevation of red blood cells, white blood cells,
                                and platelets. Using these terms as synonyms can cause confusion. In polycythemia, it is
                                likely the increase in platelets that is the major culprit of blood clots.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="py-2">
                            <p>Elevated hematocrit is the most common side-effect of testosterone treatment.[4-7] The
                                clinical significance of a high hematocrit level is unclear, but it may theoretically be
                                associated with an increased risk of thrombosis (blood clots).

                            <h4 class="text-primary font-weight-bold mb-3">What is known</h4>
                            <p class="my-3">Recognizing low testosterone in women can be difficult because the symptoms
                                are subtle and often mistaken for other health problems or lifestyle reasons. However,
                                recognizing these signs is crucial for addressing potential imbalances and improving
                                overall health.</p>

                            <p class="my-3">Hemoglobin is the protein contained in red blood cells that is responsible
                                for delivery of
                                oxygen to the tissues. To ensure adequate tissue oxygenation, a sufficient hemoglobin
                                level
                                must be maintained. The amount of hemoglobin in whole blood is expressed in grams per
                                deciliter (g/dL). The normal Hemoglobin level is 14 to 18 g/dL for males and 12 to 16
                                g/dL
                                for females.[11] When the hemoglobin level is low, the patient has anemia.
                                Erythrocytosis is
                                a condition caused by too many red cells, which results in hemoglobin levels above
                                normal,
                                often accompanied by an elevated hematocrit.</p>

                            <p class="my-3"> Hematocrit measures the volume of red blood cells compared to the total
                                blood volume (red
                                blood cells and plasma); normal hematocrit levels for men is 40 to 54% and for women 36
                                to
                                48%.[11] Both hemoglobin and hematocrit are based on whole blood and are therefore
                                dependent
                                on plasma volume. If a patient is dehydrated, the hemoglobin and hematocrit will be
                                higher
                                than if the patient were normovolemic; if the patient is fluid overloaded, values will
                                be
                                lower than their actual level.</p>

                            <p class="my-3">Testosterone has a well-documented erythrogenic effect that increases red
                                blood cell
                                production.</p>
                            <p class="my-3">Testosterone treatment is associated with a dose-dependent increase in
                                hemoglobin and
                                hematocrit levels [16-18]; the increases in hemoglobin and hematocrit are greater in
                                older
                                men than in young men.[18, 19] The effect of testosterone therapy on erythropoiesis may
                                become evident at three months and peaks after approximately twelve months.</p>

                            <p class="my-3">An increased hematocrit is associated with increased blood viscosity (“blood
                                thickening”),
                                increased platelet activation/aggregation, decreased venous return and shortened
                                bleeding
                                time.[8, 9, 21-25] Although stimulation of red blood cell production with an ensuing
                                rise in
                                hemoglobin and hematocrit is beneficial for patients with anemia, it is theoretically
                                possible that elevations above the normal range may have unintended consequences.</p>

                            <p class="my-3"> The potential risk of hematocrit elevations has been suggested by research
                                in patients with
                                polycythemia vera, which showed that a hematocrit target of less than 45% resulted in a
                                significantly lower rate of thrombosis (blood clots) and cardiovascular death than a
                                hematocrit target of 45 – 50%.[27] Polycythemia vera is a slow-growing blood cancer in
                                which
                                the bone marrow produces too many red blood cells. These excess red blood cells thicken
                                the
                                blood, slow down blood flow and cause complications, such as thrombosis, which can lead
                                to a
                                heart attack or stroke.[28] However, several studies have demonstrated that high
                                endogenous
                                testosterone levels are not associated with venous thromboembolism or deep vein
                                thrombosis
                                in healthy men.[29-31] In line with this, there is no undisputable evidence that
                                hematocrit
                                elevation following testosterone therapy increases incidence of either blood clots,
                                heart
                                attack or stroke in the general population of men.[32-37] Reported cases of venous
                                thromboembolism after testosterone treatment were almost all confined to patients with a
                                previously undiagnosed thrombophilia.[34, 38] Men with thrombophilia are more likely to
                                have
                                the Factor V Leiden mutation, high Factor VIII and high Factor XI than men given
                                testosterone therapy who did not have a venous thromboembolism.[34, 38] This is
                                supported by
                                more recent study which showed that among adult men with low testosterone levels who
                                were at
                                low to moderate baseline risk of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism – which
                                comprises the large majority of the general population of men – there is no significant
                                association between testosterone replacement therapy and risk of deep vein thrombosis or
                                pulmonary embolism.</p>

                            <p class="my-3">Two large pharmacoepidemiological studies have compared the rate of venous
                                thromboembolism
                                in men receiving testosterone treatment versus a control group (men not receiving
                                testosterone treatment).[39, 40] The first study – which I have written about previously
                                “Risk of Blood Clots in Men Receiving Testosterone Therapy” – showed that testosterone
                                treatment is not associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism.[39] The
                                second
                                study concluded that starting testosterone treatment is associated with an increased
                                risk of
                                venous thromboembolism during the first 6 months of testosterone treatment, and declines
                                thereafter.[40] A meta-analysis was recently conducted on these two studies.[33] A
                                meta-analysis is a statistical approach to combine the results from multiple studies in
                                an
                                effort to increase statistical power (over individual studies), improve estimates of the
                                effect size and/or to resolve uncertainty when studies disagree.[41, 42] This
                                meta-analysis
                                showed that testosterone treatment is not associated with an increased risk of venous
                                thromboembolism, even when the analysis was confined to the first 6 months of
                                testosterone
                                therapy.[33] Risk of blood clots seems to be more strongly associated with estrogen and
                                estrogen treatment.[43-47] The contribution of estrogen as a causal factor in venous
                                thromboembolism is supported by the World Professional Association for Transgender
                                Health
                                (WPATH), which report that the greatest risk factor of male-to-female estrogen hormone
                                treatment is venous thromboembolism.[45] This is not the case in female-to-male
                                transsexuals, who are treated with testosterone.</p>

                            <p class="my-3">Recognizing low testosterone in women can be difficult because the symptoms
                                are subtle and often mistaken for other health problems or lifestyle reasons. However,
                                recognizing these signs is crucial for addressing potential imbalances and improving
                                overall health.</p>

                            <p class="my-3"> Even though it has not been directly proven that testosterone-induced
                                elevations in
                                hematocrit may increase risk of venous thromboembolism, since it is mechanistically
                                plausible, regular monitoring of hematocrit during testosterone therapy is
                                important.[4-6,
                                48] In clinical practice, erythrocytosis commonly translates to a hemoglobin level
                                higher
                                than 18.5g/dL or an hematocrit level higher than 52% in men, although the exact cut-off
                                varies between guidelines. The Endocrine Society uses a Hematocrit level higher than 50%
                                as
                                a relative contraindication to the initiation of testosterone therapy and a hematocrit
                                level
                                higher than 54% as a reason to stop testosterone therapy until hematocrit returns to a
                                safer
                                level.[48] The European Association of Urology (EAU) also recommends 54% as the upper
                                safe
                                hematocrit threshold.[4] Other professional societies use hematocrit levels ranging from
                                52%
                                to 55% as thresholds to modify or discontinue testosterone therapy.[49] All major
                                guidelines
                                strongly recommend measuring hematocrit at baseline, at 3 and 6 months after start of
                                testosterone therapy, and then annually.[4-6, 48] It should be noted that Isolated
                                hematocrit elevations can be the result of insufficient fluid intake on a hot day or
                                dehydration following vigorous exercise. Only repeated measures of hematocrit above 54%
                                should be followed by concomitant administration of aspirin, therapeutic phlebotomy
                                and/or
                                discontinuation of testosterone treatment until hematocrit declines below 54%. After
                                normalization of hematocrit level testosterone treatment may be continued with a reduced
                                dosage.

                            <p class="my-3">Therefore, in clinical practice it is of interest to know which testosterone
                                preparations
                                tend to cause the largest and smallest elevations in hematocrit. The results from the

                    <p class="my-3">The risk of reaching hematocrit >54% is determined by the duration of
                        supraphysiologic
                        testosterone levels, which in turn is determined by testosterone formulation (and hence
                        pharmacokinetics) and dose.Short-acting intramuscular testosterone formulations
                        (testosterone cypionate and testosterone enanthate) are associated with the most rapid and
                        marked increases in testosterone levels – and hence hematocrit elevation – with supraphysiologic
                        testosterone levels achieved within days of an injection and a return to baseline after 10 to 14
                        days, followed by a decrease to sub-physiologic levels within 3 weeks if not re-injected. In
                        contrast, other testosterone formulations that result in a slower and more stable
                        increase in testosterone levels, such as long-acting testosterone undecanoate injections,
                        transdermal gels and pellets, result in a low incidence of erythrocytosis that is dependent on
                        dose and achieved testosterone level, and independent of duration of testosterone therapy.
                        Long-acting testosterone undecanoate maintains stable testosterone levels within the
                        normal range for approximately 12 weeks. Hemoglobin and hematocrit increase initially over
                        the first 3-6 months of treatment but then stabilize and remain within the normal range over the
                        entire treatment period.</p>

                    <p class="my-3"> A prospective observational study specifically examined adverse effects, including
                        hematocrit
                        elevations, of long-acting testosterone undecanoate; 347 hypogonadal men received a total of
                        3,022 testosterone undecanoate injections over 3.5 years.Only 14 patients (4%) developed a
                        hematocrit level higher than 52% and 25 patients (7%) developing a hematocrit level higher than
                        54%. In stark contrast, among men receiving short-acting testosterone enanthate injections
                        formulations, up to 67% experience hematocrit elevations higher than 50%. A previous
                        pharmacokinetic study comparing long-acting testosterone undecanoate (1,000 mg every 6 weeks,
                        followed by 1,000 mg every 9 weeks) and short-acting testosterone enanthate (250 mg every 3
                        weeks) also showed higher, stable trough testosterone levels for testosterone undecanoate at the
                        time of injections (14.9 to 16.5 nmol/L) compared with testosterone enanthate .</p>

                            <h4 class="text-primary font-weight-bold mb-3">What this analysis adds</h4>
                            <p class="my-3">Almost all previously reported cases of testosterone treatment related
                                venous thromboembolism were seen in patients with a previously undiagnosed
                                thrombophilia. Considering the low annual incidence of venous thromboembolism in
                                the general population – 48 to 120 per 100 000 people  – fear of venous
                                thromboembolism should not preclude the large majority of suffering hypogonadal men from
                                receiving testosterone therapy and its well documented health benefits. The prevalence
                                of hereditary thrombophilia has been reported to be 9% in a healthy population.
                                While screening for thrombophilia before starting testosterone therapy is warranted for
                                men with a history or family history of thrombosis, data do not justify universal
                                screening because the absolute risk remains low</p>
                            <p class="my-3">The risk of elevated hematocrit seen in patients with polycythemia vera
                                cannot be extrapolated to hematocrit elevations seen during testosterone therapy in men
                                without blood cancer or genetic mutations. Data suggest that testosterone therapy has
                                effects that may counteract the potentially increased risk of venous thromboembolism.
                                For example, testosterone therapy is one of the few treatments that reduces
                                lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] levels, in the impressive range of 20-59%. In line with
                                this, suppression of endogenous testosterone in young healthy men significantly
                                increases Lp(a) levels, up to 40-60% above baseline. It has been suggested that
                                Lp(a) may be a risk factor for venous thromboembolism. Mendelian randomization
                                studies did not confirm an association between Lp(a) with the risk of venous thrombosis
                                in the general population studies. However, a meta-analysis of eight studies in
                                pediatric populations showed that elevated Lp(a) levels are associated with a 4.5-fold
                                (odds ratio 4.50) increased risk of first onset venous thromboembolism.Lp(a) may
                                not necessarily be prothrombotic, but may tilt the balance towards thrombosis due to the
                                potential loss of fibrinolytic activity. Interestingly, the Mendelian randomization
                                studies which did not find an association between Lp(a) with the risk of venous
                                thrombosis did show an association between Lp(a) and factor V Leiden (which increases
                                risk of blood clotting). Although further study is needed, this suggests that
                                elevated Lp(a) may need a second underlying factor to generate a thrombus and that
                                reductions in Lp(a) levels may reduce the overall thrombotic propensity.</p>

                            <p class="my-3">A second reason that elevations in hematocrit with testosterone treatment
                                may not be
                                inherently dangerous is that low testosterone levels are associated with higher levels
                                of prothrombotic factors in men, regardless of age, obesity, body fat distribution, and
                                related metabolic parameters.</p>

                            <p class="my-3">Finally, an experimental study suggests that there are adaptive
                                physiological mechanisms
                                that restore whole-blood viscosity to normal during prolonged testosterone
                                administration.[79] This study comprehensively assessed the effects of testosterone on
                                whole-blood viscosity, plasma viscosity, and erythrocyte deformability, and compared sex
                                differences after short-term as well as longer-term testosterone treatments. Results
                                showed that long-term testosterone treatment did not adversely affect whole-blood
                                viscosity or plasma viscosity in adult mice, even when supraphysiologic testosterone
                                levels were reached. Interestingly, erythrocyte deformability was increased after
                                long-term high-dose testosterone treatment. In contrast, short-term treatment with
                                high-dose testosterone transiently raised whole-blood viscosity in association with
                                increased hematocrits in female and castrated male mice. The increased erythrocyte
                                deformability may offset whole-blood viscosity to a much lower level than that predicted
                                from exceptionally high hematocrits. Notably, testosterone treatment in
                                hypogonadal men has been shown to improve erythrocyte membrane composition and fluidity
                                [81], which likely improves blood rheology and contributes to a reduced thrombosis
                                risk. Testosterone also has vasodilator and anti-atherosclerotic effects that in
                                addition may explain the lack of increase in cardiovascular events with elevated
                                hematocrit during testosterone therapy.</p>

                            <p class="my-3">Support for the better tolerance to hematocrit elevations during
                                testosterone treatment
                                with testosterone undecanoate comes from a study where one patient showed constantly
                                elevated hematocrit values when treated with testosterone enanthate.[86] This patient
                                showed no elevated hematocrit levels in the 27 month follow-up study when receiving
                                testosterone undecanoate treatment. This suggests that men who experience marked
                                hematocrit elevations with short-acting injectable testosterone formulations may be
                                better able to tolerate treatment with testosterone undecanoate.</p>

                            <p class="my-3">A notable study retrospectively reviewed the charts of 217 hypogonadal men
                                older than 65
                                years who were treated with testosterone therapy, to determine the prevalence of
                                thrombotic events and all-cause mortality. There was increased all-cause mortality
                                in hypogonadal men not treated with testosterone compared to men who received
                                testosterone treatment. There was no difference in incidence of myocardial
                                infarction, transient ischemic attack, stroke or deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism
                                between patients treated with testosterone and hypogonadal men not treated with
                                testosterone. In the TEAAM (Testosterone’s Effects on Atherosclerosis Progression in
                                Aging Men) trial, of 155 men who were treated with testosterone for 3 years, 13 men (8%)
                                experienced hematocrit greater than 54%. Hence, the incidence of large hematocrit
                                elevations during long-term testosterone therapy is small. Considering the significant
                                reduction in mortality seen in several studies in testosterone treated men compared to
                                non-treated men , the small number of men experiencing hematocrit elevations
                                reaching 54% – the consequences of which are still unproven – should not deter
                                physicians from prescribing testosterone treatment to suffering hypogonadal men.</p>
