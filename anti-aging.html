            <h5 class="mb-2 font-weight-bold">Move on from Bad Habits</h5>
            <p>
              Years ago I could not stop myself from overeating everyday at 7 pm.
              One day out of desperation, I said “Evening Bryan, you’re fired. You
              make my life miserable. I can’t sleep. I’m 60 lbs overweight and I
              feel awful all the time.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Giving that version of me a name and then writing down his
              persuasive tactics such as “tonight is the last night” or “tomorrow
              we’ll work extra hard to burn off the calories” gave me the tools I
              needed to stand my ground. Evening Bryan’s authority to eat between
              5 pm and 10 pm was revoked. No matter what, Evening Bryan cannot eat
              food because if given the chance, he’ll eat too much and ruin life
              for Sleep Bryan, Morning Bryan, Work Bryan and Dad Bryan.
            </p>
            <p>
              We all have bad habits. Things we do that we don’t really want to
              do. They never actually make us happy. They in fact make us sad and
              regretful.
            </p>
            <p>Here’s one approach to move past your bad habits:</p>
            <ol class="my-2 px-4">
              <li>
                <p>
                  Identify a version of you that is responsible for self
                  destructive behavior and give them a name (i.e. Evening Bryan).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Write down the persuasion techniques they use to get what they
                  want (“today’s the last day").
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Prepare a list of rebuttals that enables you to stand your
                  ground (“this is not what we really want”, “we know this makes
                  us sad and regretful”).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  Identify which versions of you should be in charge (i.e. Morning
                  you) and give them the authority to make decisions on behalf of
                  your Evening Bryan.
                </p>

            <h5 class="mb-2 font-weight-bold">How to Sleep</h5>
            <p>
              High-quality sleep changed my life. It took me years to build the
              habits and systems that led to
              <b>eight months of 100% perfect sleep.</b> As far as I know, this is
              the best in the world. I’m going to teach you the habits for
              excellent sleep.
            </p>
            <p>
              We all know the energizing feeling of a great night’s sleep. It
              rejuvenates the body, boosts brain function, powers the immune
              system, and regulates hormones. It’s the foundation for well-being
              and longevity.
            </p>
            <p>On the other hand, sleep deprivation impairs.</p>
            <ul class="my-2 px-4">
              <li>
                <p>
                  Being constantly awake for 18 or 24 hours is equivalent to
                  having a blood alcohul content of 0.05% or 0.1%, respectively.
                  In the U.S. 0.08% is considered legally intoxicated.

              <li>
                <p>
                  Get six hours of sleep or less on average and you’re 4.2x times
                  more likely to develop the common cold.
                </p>

                  A study in young healthy participants showed a 20% increase in
                  S100-B levels following a single night of sleep deprivation, the
                  same following a traumatic brain injury.

                  One night with 4 hours of sleep showed a 70% reduction in the
                  activity of natural killer cells in 18 out of 23 participants.
                  One night of subsequent normal sleep was enough to restore NK
                  activity to its baseline. Natural killer cells are what’s
                  killing cancer cells among other functions. Preclinical studies
                  have established a causal link between the lack of sleep
                  inhibition of immune surveillance and increased tumor growth in
                  animal models.

              And if you need any more motivation, one night with 4 hours of sleep
              showed a 70% reduction in the activity of natural killer cells in 18
              out of 23 participants. One night of subsequent normal sleep was

            <p>
              Sleep deprivation diminishes cognitive functions, slows reflexes,
              and gives rise to poor decision-making. It’s linked to heart
              disease, diabetes, obesity, anxiety, depression and weakened
              immunity.

                  have your last meal of the day at least two hours (experiment
                  with 4 and 6 hours before) before bed and avoid large meals
                  close to bedtime. Eating close to bed creates large metabolic
                  demands on your body, causes blood glucose fluctuations, reduces
                  melatonin production, and disrupts your body’s natural process
                  of lowering core body temperature.

                  Caffeine has a half life of 6 hours in the blood. That means
                  that consuming a cup of coffee 6 hours before bedtime is
                  equivalent to drinking half a cup immediately before going to
                  bed! Opt for herbal teas or other relaxing drinks in the
                  evening.

                  Avoid injury. Injuries can create serious limitations, create body imbalances and cause long term
                  complications. It’s worth being cautious even if it means not doing certain things.

                  Create an exercise habit. Do it everyday, no matter what (unless you’re injured, have a limiting medical
                  condition, or under doctor's orders). You don’t even think about it. It just happens out of habit. Do
                  not
                  give yourself the option to decide.

            <p>
              Skin is the largest organ of our bodies. Up until just a few years ago, I kind of destroyed mine. I
              regularly
              got sunburns, had a poor diet, and didn’t really do anything to nurture healthy skin. Now in my 40s, the
              damage is apparent.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we started Blueprint, we had the goal to measure every organ of the body, including skin, and slow its
              speed of aging and reverse the aging damage. I had a lot of skin aging damage, and we’ve used various
              technologies to measure my skin age.
            </p>
            <p>When I started Blueprint, my skin was in the 98th percentile for damage, with a skin age of 64. Now, my
              skin
              age has improved to between 37 and 42.</p>

                  you
                  to address it. A dentist on Blueprint recommended the SomnoDent Bruxism Device, and for the first time

                  my life, my Bruxism has stopped. Wear while sleeping.

                  is
                  important to identify problems early and remove hardened plaque. Even with diligent brushing and
                  flossing
                  at home, it's difficult to remove all plaque from your teeth.

              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Reduce sugar:</b> Try sweeteners like Trehalose, Monk Fruit, Xylitol, and Allulose.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Acidic Liquid:</b> Avoid extended exposure to acidic fluids, such as coffee and lemon water.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Avoid dry mouth:</b> Stay hydrated. Saliva protects your teeth by washing away food debris,
                  neutralizing acid, carrying essential ions like calcium, which help remineralize your enamel, making it
                  stronger.

              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Wait to brush:</b> I avoid brushing my teeth 30 minutes after eating as tooth enamel is temporarily
                  softened.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>

                  <b>Travel Toothbrush:</b> If I spend the day on-the-go, I’ll take a travel toothbrush with me.
                  Throughout
                  the day you can sneak away to a bathroom and give your teeth a clean.

                  <b>Start early and be proactive -</b> I made the mistake of addressing my hair loss and graying after
                  noticing it. By age 20, about 20% of men already have some visible hair loss. Many people lose up to 50%
                  of their hair before they start to notice thinning. By age 50, up to 40% of women will have noticeable
                  hair loss. Consider starting a hair health protocol before you can visibly detect loss.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Nutrition -</b> proper nutrition is important for hair health. You’ll want to make sure you’re
                  getting
                  adequate protein, Omega-3 fatty acids, Biotin (Vitamin B7), Vitamin C, Vitamin D, Vitamin E, Iron, Zinc
                  and Biotin. The Blueprint stack has all of these.

              <li>
                <p>
                  <b>Topical hair formulation -</b> I use a topical solution, 1 mL applied to my scalp each night . I then
                  massage my scalp with a silicon scrubber for 1-2 minutes to stimulate blood flow. The formulation I use
                  (listed below) is based upon a genetic test.
                </p>
                <p>If you’re on a budget or just want a basic solution, you can try out Minoxidil 5%. Note that some
                  people
                  experience side effects with a topical such as itchy skin, headaches etc. so monitor for those.</p>
                <p>The ingredients in my formulation: Minoxidil (7%), Cetirizine HCl (1%), Latanoprost (0.004%),
                  Dutasteride
                  (0.25%), Melatonin (0.1%), Caffeine (0.2%), Tretinoin (0.0125%), Vitamin D3 (1,000IU/ML), Vitamin E (10

                  <b>Oral Minoxidil -</b> I take 3.75 mg a day. I started with 2.5 mg and evaluated for side effects. In a
                  double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial involving 90 men with androgenetic alopecia
                  AGA, oral minoxidil (5 mg daily) was found to have similar efficacy to topical minoxidil (5% solution
                  applied twice daily) after 24 weeks. Oral minoxidil is generally considered safe at low doses, but it
                  can
                  have side effects such as hypertrichosis (excessive hair growth) and headaches.
