                        <p>Research has shown chronic stress speeds up aging. Stress is also a risk factor for autoimmune
                             disorders, cancer, heart disease, and neurological diseases.<br>

                            Here are some ways to relieve stress:</p>

                                <li><p>Get plenty of rest each night</p></li>
                                <li>  <p>Go outdoors</p></li>
                                <li><p>Meditate or pray</p></li>
                                <li><p>Practice deep breathing</p></li>

                                <li><p>Try tai chi or yoga</p></li>

                        </h3>
                        <p>Your posture might play a role in aging. Some experts have suggested that craning your 
                            neck downward to look at smartphones or other electronic devices may result in neck wrinkles.

                            Holding your devices at eye level could theoretically reduce the appearance of wrinkles but 
                            also improve your posture. This change in posture can also reduce your risk of pain and injuries.</p>

                        <p>Stained, yellowed teeth can increase the physical attributes of aging. Remove stains with whitening toothpaste 
                            or strips to feel more confident about your smile. You can also prevent discoloration by:</p>

                        <p>You cannot prevent aging, but there are different ways to slow down the process and keep yourself healthy. Get enough sleep, 
                            protect your skin with sunscreen, eat a balanced diet, exercise, and manage your stress. 

                            Your body changes as you get older, and the process of aging is normal. 
                            Talk with a healthcare provider if you have questions or concerns about the aging process.</p><hr>
