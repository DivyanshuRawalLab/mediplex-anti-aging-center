                menopausal women</h3>
              <p>In discussions about women’s health, the spotlight is centered on estrogen. The almost
                exclusive focus on the role of ovarian estrogens when dealing with menopause issues has
                overshadowed the importance of other hormones. DHEA is one of them. This article will
                explain why DHEA is important for women’s health and wellbeing, and present studies on
                DHEA supplementation and its beneficial effects in peri- and post-menopausal women.

              </p>

            </div>
            <div class="blog__details__text__item">
              <h4 class="text-primary font-weight-bold mb-3">DHEA(S) levels across the lifespan
              </h4>
              <p class="my-3">DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is a pro-hormone that is produced in the
                adrenals and gets converted to testosterone and estrogen in many tissues. In the blood
                stream DHEA circulates primarily in its sulfated form DHEA-S.[1-3] The notation DHEA(S)
                refers to both DHEA and DHEA-S.

              <p class="my-3"> The sulfated from of DHEA has a longer half-life in the blood and its
                levels remain
                stable throughout the day, are not altered significantly by the menstrual cycle.[1] When
                getting a blood test for DHEA, the fraction that is routinely measured is therefore
                DHEA-S. In response to metabolic demand, DHEA-S is rapidly converted back to DHEA (e.g.
                is hydrolyzed to DHEA by sulfatases).</p>

              <p class="my-3"> In contrast to men, whose testosterone production decline gradually with
                age [2, 3],
                women face a relatively abrupt cessation of estrogen production at menopause. In both
                men and women, DHEA levels decrease approximately 80% between ages 25 and 75 year.[4, 5]
                The most dramatic fall in blood levels of DHEA(S) already occurs between the ages of
                20-30 and 40 -50 years, when levels drop by 60-70%.[4, 6, 7] Sine DHEA is transformed to
                both androgens and estrogens in tissues, such a fall in blood levels of DHEA(S) explains
                why women at menopause are not only lacking estrogens but are also likely to have been
                deprived of testosterone for several years.[6] This explains why the beneficial effects
                of DHEA supplementation are greater and more noticeable in post-menopausal women than in
                men.[8] Figure 1 illustrates the dramatic difference in sex hormone levels (estrogen and
                testosterone) between men and post-menopausal women.</p>

              <p class="my-3"></p>Figure 1: Contribution of the gonads (testis in men, ovaries in women)
              and DHEA (from
              the adrenals in both sexes) to the total pool of androgens (primarily testosterone) and
              estrogens in men (A) and women (B) with age.</p>
              <p class="my-3">One of the key benefits of testosterone in women is enhanced muscle function
                and preservation. Optimal levels of this hormone help maintain muscle mass and strength,
                which are important for overall physical health and mobility, especially as women age.
                Stronger muscles not only improve posture and balance but also enhance metabolic health,
                reducing the risk of obesity and related diseases like type 2 diabetes.



              </p>

              <p class="my-3">Testosterone is crucial for maintaining bone health as it enhances bone
                density and
                lowers the likelihood of fractures. This is particularly important during the
                post-menopausal years when the risk of osteoporosis increases due to declining hormone
                levels. By helping to maintain bone density, testosterone can decrease the likelihood of
                fractures, which are a major health concern for older women.
              </p>

              <p class="my-3">Beyond physical health, testosterone has significant impacts on mental and
                emotional
                well-being. It is known to enhance mood and reduce feelings of depression and anxiety,
                contributing to better mental health overall. Women with optimal testosterone levels
                often report higher levels of energy and a more positive outlook on life, which are
                crucial for managing daily stress and challenges.</p>

              <p class="my-3"> Moreover, testosterone can improve cognitive functions. Studies have shown
                that it helps
                maintain memory and cognitive abilities, reducing the risk of cognitive decline with
                age. This aspect of testosterone’s role is particularly valuable as it supports women in
                maintaining their independence and quality of life as they age.
              </p>

              <p class="my-3"> Additionally, balanced testosterone levels contribute to a healthier libido
                and better
                sexual function. This can lead to improved relationships and personal satisfaction,
                aspects of life that significantly contribute to overall happiness.</p>

              <p class="my-3">Overall, the health benefits of maintaining balanced testosterone levels are
                extensive
                and can profoundly affect a woman’s physical, mental, and emotional health. Recognizing
                and addressing low testosterone can be a key factor in enhancing well-being and
                improving quality of life. This understanding allows for more targeted and effective
                approaches to health care, ensuring that women receive the comprehensive support they
                need to thrive at every stage of life.</p>

            Brain Research, Vol. 182</p>

          <p class="my-3"> What follows below is an outline of the beneficial effects of DHEA supplementation
            which have
            been demonstrated in studies on post-menopausal women. It should be noted that while many
            studies presented below used a supplemental DHEA dose of 50 mg/day, in clinical practice a dose
            of 10-25 mg may be more appropriate for some women. When looking at dose-response effects in
            studies, it is important to remember that there is great inter-individual variability in both
            baseline DHEA(S) and sex hormone (estrogen and testosterone) levels, which will affect the
            response to DHEA supplementation. The ideal DHEA dose for every individual woman therefore
            should be established by blood testing under the direction of a doctor who knows how to tailor
            hormone dosages based on every individual woman’s clinical picture.</p>

              <h4 class="text-primary font-weight-bold mb-3">Can DHEA supplementation help women suffering
                from menopausal symptoms?</h4>
              <p class="my-3">Menopausal symptoms, especially hot flashes, shown a great deal of
                variability in frequency and severity between women.Aside lifestyle factors (for
                more info, see Menopause HRT basics), one major contribution to this inter-individual
                variability is the wide distribution of DHEA levels and its metabolites, estrogen and
                testosterone.</p>

              <p class="my-3"> A notable study measured blood levels of DHEA, estrogen and testosterone in
                postmenopausal women aged 42 to 74 years. It was found that the lowest and highest
                recorded levels of DHEA varied 8-fold between women.The inter-individual
                variability in testosterone and estrogen levels was even greater, 10-fold for
                testosterone and 12-fold estrogen.</p>

              <p class="my-3"> Support for the notion that the large inter-individual variability in DHEA
                levels in
                women is a main reason some women don’t suffer bothersome menopause symptoms, comes from
                DHEA supplementation studies. Oral supplementation with DHEA improves menopausal
                symptoms and mid-life depression in peri- and post-menopausal women , and
                intra-vaginal DHEA administration (Prasterone) effectively reverses vaginal atrophy and
                related sexual symptoms in post-menopausal women.</p>

              <p class="my-3"> DHEA supplementation provides benefits for both early and late
                postmenopausal women. One
                study treated early (50-55 years and late postmenopausal women (60-65 years) with oral
                DHEA 50 mg/day for 6 months.Treatment with DHEA was associated with a progressive
                improvement of the menopausal symptoms (both physical and psychological) in all groups,
                with major effects on vasomotor symptoms in the early postmenopausal women.In
                addition, cortisol levels progressively decreased in all groups. Interestingly, levels
                of allopregnanolone and beta-endorphin increased progressively and significantly in all
                women, each reaching values three times higher than baseline.Several other studies
                also showed that long-term (6-12 months) DHEA supplementation significantly boosts
                allopregnanolone and beta-endorphin levels in post-menopausal.</p>

              <p class="my-3">Allopregnanolone is a neurosteroid and beta-endorphin is a neuropeptide;
                both are
                crucial in the modulation of mood, memory and wellbeing. Neurosteroids are
                important for regeneration and repair systems in the brain, and among this class of
                molecules, allopregnanolone is been investigated for its role to promote regeneration in
                both the central and peripheral nervous systems.In experimental studies
                allopregnanolone has been found to induce regeneration of brain cells in aged mice and
                mice with Alzheimer disease, accompanied by restoration of learning and memory
                function.</p>

              <p class="my-3"> Reduced levels of allopregnanolone in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid are
                associated
                with depression, anxiety disorders, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and impulsive
                aggression.Allopregnanolone binds to the GABAA receptor and thereby exerts
                strong anxiolytic effects.It is interesting that benzodiazepine drugs (which are
                prescribed for anxiety, insomnia, relaxation etc.) also exert their effects by binding
                to the GABAA receptor.Thus, one can speculate that the beneficial effects of DHEA
                supplementation on mood and wellbeing in postmenopausal women, and alleviation of
                menopausal symptoms, is partly due to its ability to elevate allopregnanolone levels.

            <p>Note:</p>

            <p class="my-3">Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a condition in which a woman has
              severe depression
              symptoms, irritability, and tension before menstruation. The symptoms of PMDD are more
              severe than those seen with premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Because reduced levels of
              allopregnanolone are seen in women with premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and because DHEA
              supplementation increases allopregnanolone levels, it is likely that DHEA supplementation
              may alleviate premenstrual symptoms as well.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="py-1">
            <p class="my-3">Beta-endorphin is an endogenous opioid released from the pituitary gland.[33]
              Endorphins regulate mood and emotional responses, and induce analgesia, euphoria, mood state
              changes, and play a role in the reward system in the brain.[34, 35] They resemble the
              opiates (pain relieving drugs) in their ability to produce analgesia and a sense of
              well-being.</p>
            <h4 class="text-primary font-weight-bold mb-3">Can DHEA supplementation help women suffering
              from menopausal symptoms?</h4>
            <p class="my-3">When supplementing with a lower dose, 25 mg DHEA per day, increases in estradiol
              and testosterone levels are 20% to 45% lower respectively, than with the 50 mg DHEA per
              day. It should be noted the increase in blood levels of DHEA(S), estradiol, and
              testosterone is lower and less rapid with a 25 mg/day dose compared to a 50 mg/day dose.
              This has to be taken into consideration when starting DHEA supplementation as it will impact
              the time course for onset of benefits.</p>

            <p class="my-3"> Also, in these studies, while the 50 mg DHEA per day dose tripled levels of both
              allopregnanolone and beta-endorphin , the lower DHEA dose, 25 mg/day only increased
              levels of allopregnanolone and beta-endorphin two-fold.However, the lower dose was
              still reported to be effective for relief of menopausal symptoms in some women.
              As stated above, this underscores the importance of tailoring the DHEA dose to each
              individual woman and her health status.</p>

              changes, and play a role in the reward system in the brain.They resemble the
              opiates (pain relieving drugs) in their ability to produce analgesia and a sense of
              well-being.</p>
            <p class="my-3">This effectiveness of DHEA supplementation is very good news for suffering women
              who have
              contra-indications for traditional estrogen/progesterone HRT (eg. active cancer or a family
              history of breast cancer), or who don’t want to take HRT.</p>
